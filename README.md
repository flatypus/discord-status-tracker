# discord-status-tracker
A simple discord bot that tracks when someone changes their status. <br />
I also implemented an extra step that checks if someone doesn't have a status because they are offline or because they just don't have a status set <br />
This may be too much for a regular user, so just edit those lines as you wish to use the bot. <br />
